## Learn Ionic Framework 

Please watch the following video to learn the fundamentals of the ionic framework. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2ga-iXS5i4&t=1339s. 
If you're familiar with Angular 2+, the first hour should be enough.

## Generating Components

Similar to Angular, components are generated using a command. (ng generate ... ). Ionic comes with a similar command to generate ionic components. (ionic generate type name).

Please read https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/generate for more info.
