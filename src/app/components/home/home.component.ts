    This is simply an example of how to use the service classes together with components 
    to obtain data and attach it to your view.

    Please look more into javascript: promises and asnyc&await 

    The example consists of calling the GridService to obtain a floor object and setting it to the component.

    THIS EXAMPLE/CODE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE REMOVED IN THE LATER FUTURE. Please use this as a simply reference to help.
